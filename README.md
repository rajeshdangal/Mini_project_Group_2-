# Mini Project

This is a data analysis and machine learning mini project that utilizes various Python libraries for data handling, visualization, and modeling.

## 📁 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of essential data science libraries in Python to preprocess data, visualize insights, and build a predictive model using Random Forest Regression.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

This project is implemented in Python and makes use of the following libraries:

- **[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **[numpy](https://numpy.org/):** For numerical computing.
- **[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/):** For static plotting and data visualization.
- **[seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/):** For enhanced data visualizations.
- **[IPython.display](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.display.html):** For rich output display (e.g., HTML tables).
- **[tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/):** To pretty-print tabular data.
- **[warnings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html):** To suppress unnecessary warnings.
- **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/):** For machine learning, including:
  - `train_test_split` for splitting datasets
  - `RandomForestRegressor` for building a regression model
  - `mean_absolute_error`, `mean_squared_error`, and `r2_score` for model evaluation

## 📊 Model Overview

The machine learning model used in this project is a **Random Forest Regressor**, trained and evaluated using standard metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R² score.
